# numero

numero is a math library for Go. 

This README is largely a work in progress document. I am writing down my thoughts as I go along.

### motivation

I am largely just looking to do some recreational programming. I know that mature math libraries exist, but I want to build one myself and maybe, just maybe, I'll arrive at something useful for everybody else.

### packages to make

1. nlog - logger (TODO)
2. nrepl - repl (TODO)
3. nparser - equation parser (TODO)
4. nplot - graphing (TODO)
5. nmath - math functions (TODO)
6. nserver - server (TODO)
7. nutil - utils (TODO)
6. nweb - web interface (TODO)

### areas to be covered by nmath

1. function differentiation
2. function integration
3. matrices
4. vectors
5. statistics
6. probability
