# numero

numero is a math library for Go. 

This README is largely a work in progress document. I am writing down my thoughts as I go along.

## motivations

I am largely just looking to do some recreational programming. I know that mature math libraries exist, but I want to build one myself and maybe, just maybe, I'll arrive at something useful for everybody else.

Stuff I want to cover:
1. Function differentiation
2. Function integration
3. Matrices
4. Vectors
5. Statistics
6. Probability
