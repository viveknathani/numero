`numero` is software for parsing and evaluating mathematical expressions. It is available as a library and as a web service.

### motivation

This project started as an exercise in doing some recreational programming. I always knew about the [shunting yard algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunting_yard_algorithm) but never really got to implement it. Lately, I've been writing a lot of code in Go and decided to just do this.

### usage

TODO: write here

The library can be used as follows:

```bash
go get -u github.com/viveknathani/numero
```

```go

```

The web service can be consumed as follows:

```bash

```
